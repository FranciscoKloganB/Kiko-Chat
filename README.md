# Kiko-Chat

### Todo List:
#### Priority tasks
* Fix bug where connections are only possible with localhost addresses/ports instead of public IPs.
* After fixing the bug, test if messages are still passed between chats

#### Other tasks
* Check TODO annotations and/or 'NotImplementedException()' on the source code on the solution itself and implement them

### Important Notice
*This project was not tested and is not meant to be secure. Run it at your own risk. It's mostly implemented using .NET Remoting instead of the WFC standard, which was already declared as dangerous by Microsoft itself.*
